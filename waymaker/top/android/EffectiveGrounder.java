/** A searcher for an effective ground between two candidate nodes.  An effective ground is a
  * node common to the root paths of both candidates, inclusive of those candidates.  It may
  * therefore be either of the candidate nodes, or the node of a common candidate farther
  * downstream, or the actual ground.  Effective grounds have the property of flow invariance during
  * vote shifts between the two candidates; a shift from one candidate to the other is guaranteed to
  * leave the vote flow at the effective ground unchanged.  More all candidates of the effective
  * ground are themselves effective grounds, so the root path as a whole is flow invariant.
  *
  * <p>This guarantee of flow invariance rests on the assumption that the would-be voter is part of no
  * barred cycle at present, and none after the vote shift.  The consequences of invalidating this
  * assumption are unknown.</p>
  *
  * <p>Do not hold an instance of EffectiveGrounder indefinitely.  It retains the contents of its path
  * buffers for sake of speed, which may cause old forests to be witheld from the garbage collector.</p>
