<ul>
    <li>the structure of a count of a guideway <a href='../gen/poll'>poll</a>
        based on transitive voting</li>
    <li>a collection of in-trees; of arborescences each converging to a root</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The count is structured by coalescent flows of transitive votes into a forest
    of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_%28graph_theory%29'>arborescences</a>
    each converging to a root (in-trees).
    One may picture the votes streaming like raindrops down the leaves and branches to the roots.
    Accordingly the rootward direction is sometimes called ‘downstream’, and the leafward ‘upstream’.
    Always trees are pictured in natural orientation with their leaves at top and roots at bottom.

<!--
    - count generation
        | continuous count with latest version only
            - seems to be the original plan
                ( as per poll/ogw/._/androidFromHTML.task, spec/._/spec.task
      / | continuous count with micro-versioning
      /     - enables each UI to fix on a particular version for sake of consistency
      /     - most like repo in that old data is immediately available
      /     - huge footprint in long-term storage
      /         - though might reserve only versions actually needed by at least one client
      // at best premature as client must in any case be able to fully refresh
      / | periodic snapshot counts
      /     - like Votorola
      // probably too expensive at full scale
