<ul>
    <li>the structure of a <a href='../gen/poll'>poll</a> based on transitive voting</li>
    <li>a collection of in-trees; of arborescences each converging to a root</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The poll is structured by coalescent flows of transitive votes into a forest of <a
    href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_%28graph_theory%29'>arborescences</a>
    each converging to a root (in-trees).  One may picture the votes streaming together
    like raindrops down the leaves and branches of an actual forest.  Accordingly the
    leafward direction is sometimes called ‘upstream’, and the rootward ‘downstream’.
    Always the trees are pictured in natural orientation with their leaves at top and
    their roots at bottom.
