    - an ultimate contribution (c)
        - composed of segments
        - each segment is a dependency relation between (left) part of a norm
          and (right) part of another norm, or an action (a)
            - connection to norm (dashed circle) depends on form of norm
                - which may vary among overguideways
        - overall it relates individual action (a) to universal collective end (in u)
    - possible contributions are many
        - owing to many dependency relations (c')
        - collectively the contributions form a tree structure
            - rooted in u
            - branching to all contributory leaves (a)
        - normally the overguide makes no more than a few contributions at a time
    - choice among alternative norms or actions (e.g. u' or a')
        - formalized as poll (u' is a single poll, a' is another)
        - facilitated by guideways
            - each overguideway typically provides a guideway of its own for each poll
                - guideway form may vary among overguideways
    - as moral facility
        - (c) facilitates M1
        - (u', c', a') facilitate M2
