<ul>
    <li>a forest node that shares, in common with another specified node,
        either the same node immediately to its rootward, or the status of being a root itself</li>
    <li>a co-voter or co-root</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Nodes are defined as mutual peers when they either
    1) share the same node immediately to their rootward, making them co-voters of the same candidate;
    or 2) are roots of the same forest.
    A peer is further classed as ‘major’ or ‘minor’ based on the relative volume of votes
    it contributes to the combined flow of its peer group.
